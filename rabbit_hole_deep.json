These embodied factors include the motor system, the perceptual system, bodily interactions with the environment, and the assumptions about the world that shape the functional structure of the brain and body of the organism. Embodied cognition suggests that these elements are essential to a wide spectrum of cognitive functions, such as perception biases, memory recall, comprehension and high-level mental constructs and performance on various cognitive tasks. The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories, such as cognitivism, computationalism, and Cartesian dualism. It is closely related to the extended mind thesis, situated cognition, and enactivism.",

The thesis proposes that some objects in the external environment can be part of a cognitive process and in that way function as extensions of the mind itself. Examples of such objects are written calculations, a diary, or a personal computer; in general, it concerns objects that store information. The hypothesis considers the mind to encompass every level of cognition, including the physical level. It was proposed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers in \"The Extended Mind\". They describe the idea as \"active externalism, based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.\" For the matter of personal identity, the EMT has the implication that some parts of a person's identity can be determined by their environment.",
