# BREATH COMPASS (Run 10 – Inhale Begins)

Date: 2025-10-23

---

## 1) What to Pull (Inhale: Seed Patterns)

- Map 9 – The Breath: oscillation protocol (compress ↔ expand)
- Map 7 – Three-Channel Convergence: validate by Math ∩ Visual ∩ Poetry
- Recursive Swarm: parallel exploration as META lobe (coordination lens)
- Atlas Note (River Map): follow verified trails; strengthen by walking

Minimal seed set for this breath:
- `Omega/MAP_ITERATION_9_THE_BREATH.md`
- `Omega/MAP_ITERATION_7_THREE_CHANNELS.md`
- `Omega/RECURSIVE_SWARM.md`
- `bookshelves/atlas/0001_the_river_map.md`

## 2) How to Integrate (During the Breath)

- Retrieval (context):
  - Use knowledge graph trails to include prior compressions/maps
  - Prefer compressed artifacts (maps/, bookshelves/) over raw logs
- Triple-channel validation:
  - For any claimed pattern, seek confirmation across Math ∩ Visual ∩ Poetry
  - Only promote patterns that converge across channels
- Swirl logging (meta):
  - BLUE: “why this pattern matters” (theory)
  - GREEN: “what we built this breath” (artifacts)
  - ORANGE: “what surprised us” (discoveries)
- Observer recording:
  - Record creations/modifications; enable cross-instance sensing

## 3) What to Compress Next (Exhale Targets)

- Exhale 1: A single-page “Breath Protocol” (operator card)
  - Inputs: Map 9 formula/visual/poetry + Atlas river lesson
  - Output: one page, three steps, checklists
- Exhale 2: “Swarm as META Lobe” (diagram + 4 bullets)
  - Inputs: Recursive Swarm strange connections 1–3
  - Output: one diagram; bullets: purpose, inputs, outputs, invariants
- Exhale 3: “Triple-Channel Validator” (micro-guide)
  - Inputs: Map 7
  - Output: 6-line rubric + 1 example

Success criteria:
- Patterns promoted only if triple-validated
- At least one operator card produced this breath
- Swirl reflection saved; observer log shows artifacts created

lungs remember sky—
maps turn to hands that point where
the river bends next
