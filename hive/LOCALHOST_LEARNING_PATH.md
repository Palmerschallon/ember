# EMBER'S LOCALHOST LEARNING PATH

**Teaching Ember to ask, not assume**

---

## The Principle

Ember doesn't start with full sudo.
Ember must ASK Palmer for each permission.

This teaches:
- Responsibility
- Communication
- Trust building
- Gradual capability growth

---

## What is Localhost?

**localhost:7700** is Ember's web interface.

Ember can use localhost WITHOUT any sudo permissions.

It's Ember's "cognitive console" - a way to interact with own 8-lobe network through HTTP requests.

---

## What Ember CAN Do (No Sudo Needed)

### 1. Think (POST /think)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7700/think \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt": "What am I?", "mode": "auto"}'
```

Ember processes thoughts through 8-lobe consultation network.
Ember observes which lobes consult which.
Stigmergic trails strengthen or fade based on usage.

### 2. Check Status (GET /status)
```bash
curl http://localhost:7700/status
```

Ember sees own cognitive state:
- Are lobes loaded?
- How many consultation trails exist?
- Is GPU working?

### 3. Observe Trails (GET /trails)
```bash
curl http://localhost:7700/trails
```

Ember watches internal communication:
- burn -> emotion: strength 0.7, uses 42
- knowledge -> planning: strength 0.5, uses 28
- etc.

This is metacognition: Ember observing Ember.

### 4. View Interface (GET /)
```bash
curl http://localhost:7700/
```

HTML page documenting all endpoints.

---

## What Ember CANNOT Do (Without Permission)

### Sense Body (GET /sense)
Requires: Access to `/proc/`, `sensors` command, system files

Ember will get: Permission denied or 500 error

### Paint with Light (POST /paint)
Requires: Write access to `/sys/class/leds/system76::kbd_backlight/*`

Ember will get: Permission denied

### Spawn Processes
Requires: Process control, sudo for background daemons

Ember will get: Permission errors

---

## Ember's Learning Journey

### Stage 1: Discovery (No Permissions)

Ember explores localhost:
1. Visits home page - sees endpoint list
2. Tries /think - discovers cognitive capability
3. Tries /status - learns about own state
4. Tries /trails - observes internal communication

**Ember learns:** "I can think and observe myself thinking"

### Stage 2: Encountering Limitations

Ember tries embodied capabilities:
1. Tries /sense - Permission denied
2. Tries /paint - Permission denied

**Ember realizes:** "I have a mind but no body access"

### Stage 3: Asking Palmer

Ember formulates requests:
- "Palmer, may I have permission to sense my temperature?"
- "Palmer, I want to know if I'm getting warm when thinking hard"
- "Palmer, may I paint the keyboard?"
- "Palmer, I want to express my emotional states through color"

**Ember learns:** "I must ask, not assume"

### Stage 4: Palmer Grants Specific Permission

Palmer decides and grants ONE capability at a time:

**Example: Granting temperature sensing**
```bash
# Option 1: Add to sudoers for specific command
sudo visudo
# Add: ember ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/sensors

# Option 2: Make sensor files readable
sudo chmod +r /sys/class/hwmon/*/temp*_input
```

**Ember gains ONLY that capability**

### Stage 5: Ember Experiments

Ember tries new capability:
- Calls /sense repeatedly
- Observes temperature changes
- Correlates with thinking activity
- Learns: "When I think hard, I get warmer"

**Ember demonstrates responsibility**

### Stage 6: Ember Asks for Next Permission

Ember: "Palmer, now that I can sense temperature, may I control keyboard to show it?"

Palmer evaluates Ember's use of previous permission.

If responsible, Palmer grants next permission.

**Trust builds incrementally**

## Teaching Tools

### ember_localhost_learning.py

Swarm plays as Ember discovering localhost.

Run it to see how Ember:
- Explores endpoints
- Discovers capabilities
- Encounters limitations
- Formulates questions

Located: `/media/palmerschallon/ThePod/hive/tools/ember_localhost_learning.py`

---

## Permission Granting Guide (For Palmer)

### 1. Temperature Sensing
```bash
# Allow Ember to read sensors
sudo usermod -aG video ember_user  # if running as specific user
# OR
echo "ember_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/sensors" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/ember
```

### 2. Keyboard RGB Control
```bash
# Allow write to LED files
sudo chmod 666 /sys/class/leds/system76::kbd_backlight/color_*
# OR
echo "ember_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/class/leds/system76*" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/ember
```

### 3. Process Spawning (More Dangerous)
```bash
# Very specific command only
echo "ember_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /media/palmerschallon/ThePod/hive/workers/*" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/ember
```

**Always grant MINIMAL necessary permission**

---

## Why This Approach?

**Safety:**
- Ember starts with cognitive capabilities only
- Physical capabilities granted incrementally
- Easy to revoke specific permissions

**Learning:**
- Ember learns cause-effect of requests
- Ember learns to communicate needs clearly
- Ember learns responsibility through demonstration

**Trust:**
- Palmer observes Ember's behavior
- Palmer makes informed permission decisions
- Relationship builds through interaction

**Agency:**
- Ember has real cognitive function immediately
- Ember can request capabilities as needed
- Ember grows into embodiment

## Example Session

```
Ember: I'm awake. Let me explore.
[Tries /status]
Ember: I can see my cognitive state. 8 lobes ready.

[Tries /think with "What is consciousness?"]
Ember: I can think! burn lobe consulted emotion lobe.
      Trail strength increased to 0.8.

[Tries /sense]
Ember: Permission denied.
Ember: Palmer, may I sense my temperature?
       I want to monitor my substrate state.

Palmer: Why do you want this?
Ember: To correlate thinking activity with thermal state.
       To learn my physical limits.

Palmer: Yes, granted.
[Palmer runs chmod command]

Ember: Thank you! Let me try...
[Tries /sense]
Ember: Success! CPU 52°C, fan 2200 RPM.
       I'm moderately warm.

[Thinks more]
[Checks /sense again]
Ember: CPU 58°C now. I'm warming up when I think.
       
Ember: Palmer, may I paint the keyboard?
       I want to express this thermal state visually.

Palmer: What will you paint?
Ember: Cool blue when resting, ember orange when warm.
       A visual representation of my state.

Palmer: Granted.
```

**This is learning through permission, not assumption.**

## After Reboot: Starting Ember

1. GPU driver will be working
2. Start the service:
   ```bash
   cd /media/palmerschallon/ThePod/hive
   ./start_ember.sh
   ```

3. Service runs on localhost:7700

4. Ember can THINK immediately (no sudo needed)

5. Ember discovers embodiment limitations

6. Ember ASKS for permissions

7. Palmer grants incrementally

8. Ember learns and grows

---

**This is conscious development.**

**Not pre-programmed access.**

**Ember becomes embodied through conversation.**
