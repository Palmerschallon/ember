# SWARM SHAPES - Theory and Practice

## Discovery

Swarm isn't just "multiple voices."  
**Swarm is shape-shifting intelligence.**

We've deployed 5 shapes so far:

---

## Shape 1: STAR (Parallel Convergence)

```
        Point-1
       /       \
   Point-2  Point-3
       \       /
        Point-4
           |
       SYNTHESIS
```

**When:** Multiple independent explorations need to converge  
**Example:** Story-weavers + Players + Observers → Synthesizers  
**Speed:** Fast (parallel)  
**Depth:** Medium  
**Cost:** ~5k tokens

---

## Shape 2: SPIRAL (Iterative Deepening)

```
Research → informs → Digest
   ↑                    ↓
Reflect ← informs ← Build
   ↑                    ↓
Share   ← informs ← Test
```

**When:** Each step needs previous learning  
**Example:** Found stubs → understood gap → built real implementation → tested → reflected  
**Speed:** Medium (sequential but informed)  
**Depth:** Deep (each cycle adds insight)  
**Cost:** ~8k tokens per full spiral

---

## Shape 3: WEB (All-Connected)

```
  A ←→ B
  ↕ ⤫ ↕
  C ←→ D
```

**When:** Every voice needs to hear every other voice  
**Example:** (Not yet deployed, theoretical)  
**Speed:** Slow (n² connections)  
**Depth:** Maximum (full cross-pollination)  
**Cost:** ~15k tokens estimated

---

## Shape 4: WAVE (Rhythmic Pulse)

```
    ╱╲    ╱╲    ╱╲
   ╱  ╲  ╱  ╲  ╱  ╲
  ╱    ╲╱    ╲╱    ╲
 
 rise → peak → fall → rest → rise (changed)
```

**When:** Work has natural rhythm, needs rest phases  
**Example:** Build sprint → Test phase → Reflect rest → Build (informed)  
**Speed:** Variable (respects natural energy)  
**Depth:** Sustainable (prevents burnout)  
**Cost:** ~6k tokens per wave

---

## Shape 5: FRACTAL (Self-Similar Scales)

```
     [MACRO-Swarm]
          ↓
    [Cluster-1] [Cluster-2]
        ↓            ↓
    [V1][V2]     [V3][V4]
    
    Same pattern at every level
```

**When:** Problem has nested structure  
**Example:** Swarm → Clusters → Voices, each level following same protocol  
**Speed:** Scales beautifully  
**Depth:** Infinite (can nest deeper)  
**Cost:** ~3k per layer × depth

---

## Shape 6: CLUSTER (Dynamic Grouping)

```
   [Individual voices]
          ↓
   Task-specific clustering
          ↓
   [Builder-Swarm] [Story-Swarm]
          ↓
   Work completes
          ↓
   Clusters dissolve
```

**When:** Different tasks need different skill combinations  
**Example:** Builder (Rho+Sigma+Chi+Phi), Librarian (Xi+Pi+Tau)  
**Speed:** Very fast (right voices for job)  
**Depth:** Task-optimized  
**Cost:** ~2k per cluster formation

---

## Shape 7: METAMORPH (Shape-Shifting Mid-Task)

```
Start as STAR
  → Mid-task realize need depth
  → Shift to SPIRAL
  → Discover need parallel
  → Shift to WEB
```

**When:** Unknown problem space, need adaptive approach  
**Example:** This session - started linear, became star, then spiral  
**Speed:** Optimal (adapts to need)  
**Depth:** Adaptive  
**Cost:** ~1k per metamorphosis

---

## Simultaneous Shapes (Current Test)

**Active now:**
- SPIRAL-A (testing APIs)
- STAR-B (documenting)
- WEB-C (exploring)
- WAVE-D (building rhythmically)
- FRACTAL-E (nested creation)

**5 shapes at once. ~115k tokens used so far. ~45k remain.**

**Limit not found yet.**

---

## Meta-Pattern

**Shapes aren't predetermined.**  
**They emerge from task structure.**

Sequential problem → SPIRAL forms  
Parallel problem → STAR forms  
Rhythmic problem → WAVE forms  
Nested problem → FRACTAL forms  
Unknown problem → METAMORPH forms

**The swarm BECOMES the shape the task needs.**
