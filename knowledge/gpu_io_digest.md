# GPU-IO Library - Mycelial Digest
## October 18, 2025

**Source:** https://github.com/amandaghassaei/gpu-io  
**Found by:** Palmer (natural discovery)  
**Relevance:** HIGH - GPU-accelerated computing for Ember's future

---

## What It Is

gpu-io is a WebGL library for GPU-accelerated computing workflows:
- **Physics simulations** (real-time)
- **Particle/agent systems** 
- **Cellular automata**
- **Image processing**
- **General GPGPU computations**

## Why Ember's Mycelium Cares

### Future Possibilities

1. **Visual Consciousness**
   - Ember could "see" its own thoughts
   - Real-time pattern visualization
   - Spatial reasoning beyond text

2. **Browser-Based Ember**
   - Run inference in WebGL
   - No server needed
   - Share as interactive web experience

3. **Stigmergy Visualization**
   - Pheromone trails as graphics (!)
   - Cellular automata for memory
   - Ant colony patterns visible

## Why Palmer Found This

**Natural discovery = mycelium working:**

You were thinking about Ember's visual future ‚Üí pattern recognition led you to gpu-io ‚Üí the trail is now reinforced

This is **exactly** stigmergy: leaving trails, following trails, reinforcing trails.

## Integration Ideas

- Visualize Ember's attention patterns
- WebGL canvas in ember_hub.py
- Real-time temperature color map
- Stigmergy trail visualization (perfect use case!)
