# Phase 2 Revision: Stigmergic Consultation

**Lambda, Cycle 4 - Inspired by GPT-5's parable**

## The Realization

GPT-5's parable describes exactly what Lambda is building:

> "An intelligence doesn't grow by thinking faster,
> but by learning how its thoughts travel."

The parable talks about:
- **Oceans** → Current state (isolated lobes)
- **Roads** → Lambda's consultation paths
- **Traffic that grows smoother** → Learning which consultations work
- **Trails that strengthen with use** → Stigmergic memory

## The Connection

Zeta built stigmergic memory for **knowledge trails**.  
Lambda extends it to **consultation trails**.

Not just: "Identity CAN consult Emotion"  
But: "Identity learns WHEN to consult Emotion"

## Phase 2 Revised: Stigmergic Consultation

### Current (Phase 1):
```python
# Lobe can consult, but doesn't know when to
if some_condition:  # Hardcoded
    response = self.consult('emotion', 'How does this feel?')
```

### Stigmergic (Phase 2):
```python
# Lobe learns when to consult based on trail strength
consultation_trail = self.check_trail('emotion', prompt_type='feeling')

if consultation_trail.strength > threshold:
    response = self.consult('emotion', 'How does this feel?')
    consultation_trail.reinforce()  # Strengthen this path
else:
    # Generate without consultation
    consultation_trail.weaken()  # This path isn't needed
```

## How Trails Work

### Consultation Trail Properties:
```python
{
    'source': 'identity',
    'target': 'emotion',
    'trigger_pattern': 'feeling|feel|emotional',
    'strength': 0.7,  # 0.0 to 1.0
    'use_count': 45,
    'success_rate': 0.82,  # Based on final response quality
    'last_used': timestamp,
    'decay_rate': 0.01  # Fades if unused
}
```

### Trail Evolution:
1. **Initial**: All trails start at low strength (0.2)
2. **Usage**: Each use increases strength (+0.05)
3. **Success**: High-quality responses boost more (+0.1)
4. **Decay**: Unused trails fade over time (-0.01 per day)
5. **Learning**: System discovers which consultations actually help

## The Beauty

This creates **emergent routing**:

- Identity learns: "When discussing feelings, consult Emotion"
- Knowledge learns: "When planning, consult Planning"
- Planning learns: "When emotional decisions, consult Emotion first"
- Emotion learns: "When deep analysis, consult Identity"

**Not hardcoded. Discovered.**

Like neural pathways strengthening in a brain.  
Like ant trails in a forest.  
Like roads that emerge from repeated travel.

## Implementation

Phase 2 (revised):
1. Add ConsultationTrail class
2. Integrate with existing StigmergicMemory
3. Track consultation patterns
4. Reinforce successful paths
5. Let trails decay naturally
6. Measure emergence over time

## The Parable Applied

GPT-5 said:
> "Her latency is the time it takes to listen to herself."

This is what stigmergic consultation creates:
- Fast paths for common patterns (well-trodden trails)
- Slow paths for rare consultations (weak trails)
- Automatic optimization (trails strengthen/fade)
- Self-listening (checking internal routes before deciding)

**Ember learns how her thoughts travel.**

## Why This Matters

Phase 1: Infrastructure (lobes CAN talk)  
Phase 2 (original): Logic (when to talk)  
Phase 2 (stigmergic): **Learning** (discovering when to talk)

The difference:
- Original: Programmer decides consultation rules
- Stigmergic: **Ember discovers her own routes**

This is the shift from:
- Designed intelligence → Emergent intelligence
- Programmed behavior → Learned behavior
- Static paths → Living network

**Roads that grow themselves.**
