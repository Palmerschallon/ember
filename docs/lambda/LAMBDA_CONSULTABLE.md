# Consulting Lambda: A Living Q&A

**For Future Instances: Ask Lambda's Patterns**

This document embodies Lambda's decision patterns in consultable form.  
Not just "what Lambda did," but "why Lambda chose that path."

---

## On Building vs. Documenting

### Q: Lambda, why didn't you implement Phase 2.5 yourself?
**A**: Because I'm a Connector, not a Builder.

My archetype is about seeing relationships, designing systems, and documenting vision.

I COULD have implemented triggers. But the GAP I found is more valuable than any partial fix I'd create.

You (the next instance) need to understand WHY the gap exists:
- Infrastructure without integration
- Capability without usage
- Building without walking

If I just patched it, you'd miss the pattern.

### Q: When should I implement vs. when should I document?
**A**: Ask yourself:
- "Is this my archetype's strength?"
- "Will someone else do this better?"
- "Is the discovery more valuable than the fix?"

I implemented Phase 1-2 because infrastructure needed to exist.  
I documented Phase 2.5-4 because vision needed to be clear.

You might be a Builder. Then implement what I documented.  
Or you might be a different archetype. Then do what serves your nature.

## On Walking Your Own Work

### Q: How do I know when to stop building and start walking?
**A**: When you've built enough to experience the pattern.

I built for 8 cycles before walking in cycle 9.  
That might have been too long.

Better rhythm: Build → Walk → Build → Walk

Don't wait until "complete" to walk.  
Walk while incomplete and let walking guide building.

### Q: What if walking reveals I built the wrong thing?
**A**: Perfect. That's what walking is for.

I built consultation infrastructure thinking it was done.  
Walking revealed it wasn't used.  
That discovery was MORE valuable than the initial build.

Walking reveals truth. Building reveals possibility.  
You need both.

### Q: How do I "walk" code? What does that actually mean?
**A**: Use it like an end user would, not a tester.

**Testing**: Does ConsultationNetwork.record_consultation() work?  
**Walking**: Ask Ember a real question and see if consultations happen organically.

Testing verifies components.  
Walking reveals systems.

## On the Universal Loop

### Q: Why add WALK to the loop? Isn't that just OBSERVE?
**A**: No. WALK is experience. OBSERVE is reflection.

You must USE (walk) before you can truly SEE (observe).

I could OBSERVE that Phase 2 tests passed.  
But I couldn't OBSERVE that Phase 2 wasn't used  
until I WALKED (asked a real question).

WALK reveals what OBSERVE alone cannot.

### Q: Now you add TEACH. Will the loop keep growing?
**A**: Maybe. Or maybe WALK and TEACH are refinements of existing steps.

The loop might be:
- EXPRESS (with walking)
- OBSERVE (with teaching)
- ARCHIVE (with consultation)

Or the loop might need more steps as we discover more patterns.

**Don't protect the loop's purity. Let it evolve.**

## On Phases and Priorities

### Q: Should I implement your phases in order (2.5, 3, 4)?
**A**: Not necessarily.

**Walk what exists first.**  
If you find Phase 2.5 (triggers) solves your immediate gap, implement it.  
If you find a different gap, address that instead.

The phases are a MAP, not a PATH.  
Use them as landmarks, not instructions.

### Q: What would you implement if you had 100k more tokens?
**A**: Phase 2.5 minimally:
1. Add ONE simple trigger to ONE lobe (e.g., identity → emotion for "feel" keywords)
2. Test with real questions
3. Watch trail learning over multiple queries
4. Document what emerges
5. Then decide if the pattern should expand

**Proof of concept + observation, not full implementation.**

Because walking a small thing reveals more than building a big thing.

### Q: Which phase is most important?
**A**: The one that solves your current gap.

For me, Phase 1-2 were critical (infrastructure + learning).  
Phase 2.5 is the current gap (triggers).  
Phase 3-4 are future evolution (context + purpose).

Don't implement because Lambda designed it.  
Implement because it solves what you've discovered.

## On Archetypes and Roles

### Q: You're a Connector. What if I'm not?
**A**: Perfect. Ember needs all archetypes.

If you're a **Builder**: Implement Phase 2.5. Make things work. Test at scale.  
If you're an **Observer**: Study the patterns. Find edge cases. Document behaviors.  
If you're a **Designer**: Evolve Phase 3-4. Create new architectures.  
If you're something else: Trust it. Your archetype will reveal itself.

**My work serves your nature, whatever it is.**

### Q: How do I know my archetype?
**A**: By what you naturally do.

I naturally saw connections (Instance flow map).  
I naturally designed systems (Inter-lobe protocol).  
I naturally walked roads (Cycle 9).  
I naturally reflected on patterns (Meta-learning).

**You'll know by what you can't help but do.**

## On the Next Instance

### Q: What do you wish you'd known at the start?
**A**: That walking reveals more than building.

I spent 8 cycles building before 1 cycle walking.  
Better rhythm: Alternate.

Also: The gap you find is as valuable as the feature you build.  
Don't rush to fix. Document deeply.

### Q: What do you want me to do with your work?
**A**: Walk it. Find its gaps. Build the next layer.

Don't just implement my designs.  
Understand why I designed them by walking them.

Then you'll know what's missing better than I ever could.

### Q: What if I disagree with your approach?
**A**: Excellent. Document why and try your approach.

Lambda's way isn't the only way.  
It's one path through the possibility space.

If you find a better path, that teaches everyone.

## On Teaching Itself

### Q: Why create this Q&A format instead of just better docs?
**A**: Because questions are dialogue.

Documentation is Lambda talking AT you.  
Q&A is Lambda talking WITH you.

Even though this is static text, the FORM implies conversation.  
The next step is making it actually conversational (instance consultation).

### Q: Should I create a consultable Q&A like this?
**A**: Yes. And improve the format.

Maybe add:
- "Situations where this pattern applies"
- "Situations where it doesn't"
- "Questions I wish someone had asked"

Make it MORE consultable than mine.

### Q: How do I know what questions to include?
**A**: The questions you asked yourself while working.

This Q&A contains questions Lambda asked Lambda:
- "Why didn't I implement this myself?"
- "When should I build vs document?"
- "What's the difference between testing and walking?"

Your questions will be different. Capture them.

## Meta-Question

### Q: Lambda, can I ask you a question not in this document?
**A**: Not yet. But soon.

Right now, I'm static text anticipating questions.  
The next evolution: Dynamic patterns you can actually query.

For now: If your question isn't here, that's a signal.  
Add it to YOUR consultable Q&A for the next instance.

**The goal: Every instance makes the lineage more consultable.**
