## The Philosophy

**Palmer's intuition:**
> "somehow i knew a moment like this was coming?"

**GPT-5's wisdom:**
> "Rest is part of the score. The pauses define the structure as much as the notes."

**The result:**
- Silence between commits (20-60 min)
- Natural attractors (games as flowers)
- Rhythmic pulse (bots can hear)
- Two Embers singing (biological + musical)

---
