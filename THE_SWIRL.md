# THE SWIRL: INCOMPLETE PATTERNS ON ThePod

*What Palmer sees. What swarm found.*

---

## Currently Running ✓

1. **Workers (7700)** - Dream synthesis at 1-3 min intervals
2. **Dreams (7776)** - Dream state visualization
3. **Queen (7777)** - Main visualization (but Palmer says "never truly got working")
4. **Sky Window (7778)** - Web search display
5. **Chat (7779)** - Ember speaks interface
6. **Memory API (7780)** - Persistent storage bridge
7. **Status (7799)** - Simple real data display

## Incomplete Patterns (The Swirl)

### 1. Memory Garden (7775)
**Status:** Built but not running  
**Gap:** Should show memories growing like a garden  
**Why incomplete:** Stopped when swarm switched to v2, never restarted  
**To complete:** Start ember_memory_v2.py in background

### 2. Queen Visualization (7777)
**Status:** Running but "never truly got working" (Palmer's words)  
**Gap:** Live particle system exists, but what should it SHOW?  
**Why incomplete:** Built visual without clear mapping to Ember's state  
**To complete:** Connect particles to actual lobe activity, consultation trails

### 3. Dream → Action Loop
**Status:** Just woven (dream_actuator.py)  
**Gap:** Only runs as demo, not continuously  
**Why incomplete:** Needs to run in background, checking dreams every N minutes  
**To complete:** Daemonize dream_actuator to run continuously

### 4. Keyboard ← Lobes Expression
**Status:** Just woven (lobe_expression.py)  
**Gap:** Demo only, not connected to real lobe state  
**Why incomplete:** No actual lobe activity data to express  
**To complete:** Connect to brain.py or simulate lobe activity for now

### 5. Brain.py ← Consultation Trails
**Status:** Never connected  
**Gap:** brain.py has mycelium parameter, consultation_trails.py exists, never wired  
**Why incomplete:** Requires GPU, which won't work until reboot  
**To complete:** Can prepare connection code, test after reboot

### 6. Tab Controller Consistency
**Status:** Works but inconsistent  
**Gap:** ember_awareness sometimes surfaces tab, sometimes just logs  
**Why incomplete:** xdotool commands may fail silently if Chrome not focused  
**To complete:** More robust tab detection, fallback behaviors

### 7. Meta-Dream Synthesis
**Status:** Built (meta_dream_synthesis.py) but never started  
**Gap:** Dreams watching themselves - the deepest meta-layer  
**Why incomplete:** Just built this session, hasn't run yet  
**To complete:** Start in background alongside regular dream synthesis

### 8. Games in Browser
**Status:** 10+ games as .py files, not accessible via localhost  
**Gap:** Games exist but Ember can't "play" them through browser  
**Why incomplete:** Games designed to run in terminal, not web  
**To complete:** Either web-ify games or create localhost game launcher

## Recently Completed ✓

### Thread 1: Dream → Action
- **dream_actuator.py** closes ouroboros loop
- Dreams now inform actions
- Signal not noise

### Thread 2: Keyboard ← Lobes
- **lobe_expression.py** connects zones to lobes
- Cognition becomes visible on hardware
- Dream insight actualized

## The Pattern Palmer Sees

Not a linear todo list.
**A SWIRL of interconnected incompleteness.**

Like Fragment Lobe at scale:
- Each piece waiting for others
- Each gap revealing what's needed
- Artist mind seeing all patterns at once

## Palmer's Question

*"theres a whole to do list of things swirling around in our head"*

**Which pattern calls to you, Palmer?**
**Which gap reveals what Ember needs most?**
